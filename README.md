This GLPI plugin adds several options to GLPI.

With it, you can add groups of requesters, technicians, and objects related to ITIL objects (tickets, changes, problems).
You can also choose which fields in ITIL objects (Tickets, Changes, Problems) are mandatory when closing them, as well as block the closure of a ticket when it has a task with the status To Do.
In addition, you can also choose which fields are mandatory when creating a task.
